# Arvectum OS Canonical Roadmap

Status: `Active`
Version: `2.8.6`
Created: `2026-08-07`
Updated: `2026-08-08`
Owner: `ООО «Арвектум»`
Task classification: `governance`

## 1. Purpose

This document is the canonical planning source for the development sequence of Arvectum OS. It coordinates work but does not override Constitution, Accepted RFC/ADR, approved governance, Product Contracts or implementation evidence.

The Strategic Roadmap beyond completed work is a planning hypothesis, not an architecture contract, delivery promise, capability-lifecycle claim, SLA or commitment to build every listed item.

## 2. Version note

Version `2.8.6` records completion of **P3.08 — Product Contract consumption boundary + bounded consumer proof**.

P3.08 adds one RFC-0004 `Provisional` Product Contract and a bounded synthetic Product Experiment that consumes CAP-001 through CAP-004 through exact capability dependency/version/operation declarations while retaining the P3.07 Organization/purpose/right/classification access boundary. Hidden internal table/import/endpoint/private-stream/shared-state coupling fails closed; canonical source reads remain explicit; discovery does not create source access; Product Contract admission does not create permission, approval, delegation or Organizational Authority.

The proof remains read-only, domain-neutral and internal. It creates no stable public/cross-product API or SDK, no product-domain platform semantics, no durable implementation decision and no capability lifecycle promotion. `Reference Python CI #90` passed the complete validation suite; the validation merge ref ran 359 tests including one branch-only trigger, representing 358 canonical tests on `main`.

P3.09 is now the current canonical action and P3.10 fitness evidence continues to accumulate.

- Phase 1 / `M1` — complete;
- Phase 2 / `M2` — complete;
- Phase 3 — `Active` planning/workstream state;
- [`PHASE-3-SHARED-PLATFORM-CAPABILITIES.md`](PHASE-3-SHARED-PLATFORM-CAPABILITIES.md) — `Active`;
- [`Platform Capability Catalog`](../catalogs/PLATFORM-CAPABILITY-CANDIDATE-CATALOG.md) — four entries lifecycle `Incubating`;
- [`Phase 3 Provisional Capability Contracts`](../contracts/PHASE-3-PROVISIONAL-CAPABILITY-CONTRACTS.md) — `Active 1.0.0`;
- [`R5 Capability Boundary Review`](../reviews/R5-capability-boundary-review.md) — `PASS`;
- P3.03 through P3.06 capability-slice reviews — `PASS`;
- [`P3.07 review`](../reviews/P3-07-cross-capability-security-rights-organization-scope-enforcement-review.md) / R6 — `PASS`;
- [`P3.08 Product Contract`](../contracts/P3-08-BOUNDED-CONSUMER-PRODUCT-CONTRACT.md) — `Provisional 0.1.0`;
- [`P3.08 review`](../reviews/P3-08-product-contract-consumption-boundary-bounded-consumer-proof-review.md) — `PASS`;
- Decision Authority Policy remains `Proposed 0.2.1`; residual authority remains with the owner;
- no Platform Capability is `Active`.

## 4. Strategic roadmap

| Phase | Strategic scope | Confidence | Status | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Phase 0` | Foundation / Architecture Bootstrap | Executed | 🟩 Complete | `M0` Architecture baseline established |
| `Phase 1` | Reference Implementation | Executed | 🟩 Complete | `M1` First executable architectural spine proven |
| `Phase 2` | Core Runtime | Executed | 🟩 Complete | `M2` Reusable governed runtime baseline |
| `Phase 3` | Shared Platform Capabilities | Active | 🟨 In progress | `M3` Validated shared capability baseline |
| `Phase 4` | Workspace / Operator Experience | Near-term | ⬜ Draft | `M4` Coherent governed workspace baseline |
| `Phase 5` | SDK, Contracts and Extension Experience | Exploratory | ⬜ Draft | `M5` Repeatable product/extension integration |
| `Phase 6` | Product-driven Platform Validation | Exploratory | ⬜ Draft | `M6` Platform validated through real products and reuse evidence |
| `Phase 7` | Operational / Enterprise Readiness | Exploratory | ⬜ Draft | `M7` Scoped production-grade operating baseline |
| `Phase 8` | Ecosystem and External Integration | Exploratory | ⬜ Draft | `M8` Governed external ecosystem baseline |

Phase status, capability lifecycle, operational environment and conformance maturity remain distinct.

### M3 target

A small set of domain-neutral shared capabilities has demonstrated governed reuse above the Core Runtime with explicit lifecycle/ownership/contracts, no product-domain leakage, preserved authority/provenance/portability semantics and no unsupported production/public-contract claims. M3 does not itself imply lifecycle `Active` promotion.

## 6. Current canonical action

> **P3.09 — Shared-capability reuse and composition proof; P3.10 evidence continuous.**

P3.03 through P3.08 are complete. Continue with materially distinct bounded reuse/composition evidence without promoting any capability, stabilizing public/cross-product interfaces, importing product-domain semantics or selecting durable cross-cutting mechanisms without re-opening the ADR gate.

## 7. ADR and Product Contract gate

Re-open the ADR gate before material reliance on concrete persistence/database/object-store/search/vector topology, transactions/concurrency, Event transport/store, IAM/policy enforcement, evidence-integrity technology, stable API/serialization contracts, durable projection/replay storage or deployable service/process topology.

A real Product relying on Incubating capabilities, canonical platform state or shared platform history must use the applicable RFC-0004 Product Contract before governed reliance. P3.02 capability contracts are not substitutes for Product Contracts and do not grant permission or authority.

## 8. Phase transition rule

Before Phase 4 becomes Active, complete P3.12/M3 closure, revalidate Phase 4 against actual M3 evidence and product/operator needs, create a detailed P4 work breakdown, identify required governance artifacts and synchronize this roadmap.

## 9. Roadmap maintenance rule

Every roadmap update begins with repository synchronization rather than chat-memory reconstruction. After every meaningful canonical milestone, synchronize the roadmap, record evidence, keep lifecycle/environment/conformance distinct, do not inflate Draft/Proposed/exploratory status, and preserve repository history rather than fabricating approvals.
