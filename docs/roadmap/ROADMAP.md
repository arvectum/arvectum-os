# Arvectum OS Canonical Roadmap

Status: `Active`
Version: `2.14.0`
Created: `2026-08-07`
Updated: `2026-08-08`
Owner: `ООО «Арвектум»`
Task classification: `governance`

## 1. Purpose

This document is the canonical planning source for the development sequence of Arvectum OS. It coordinates work but does not override Constitution, Accepted RFC/ADR, approved governance, Product Contracts or implementation evidence.

The Strategic Roadmap beyond completed work is a planning hypothesis, not an architecture contract, delivery promise, capability-lifecycle claim, SLA or commitment to build every listed item.

## 2. Version note

Version `2.14.0` records completion of **P4.03 — Canonical Record / Relationship inspection experience** with `PASS` and advances the current canonical action to **P4.04 — Version, Event, provenance and reconstruction experience**.

P4.03 adds a bounded internal read-only inspection boundary over the existing RFC-0002 Canonical Record and Typed Relationship semantic owners. It preserves stable Subject Identity, exact immutable Version Identity, Canonical Head versus Effective Version, authority/source meaning, owner/Organization/lifecycle context, immutable history, exact Relationship Type versioning, traversal direction and SubjectIdentity/VersionIdentity endpoint roles. Missing or ambiguous Effective Version is surfaced explicitly rather than silently resolved.

The R9 source-resolution handoff is now executable: one current Actor/Organization/Subject authorization decision is required before source existence/multiplicity or exact-Version disclosure, and actual source Organization membership is independently checked from source-owned governed state rather than presentation wrappers, `Identity.scope` text or identifier syntax. Relationship edges require their own current relationship authorization and omitted edges disclose no protected relationship identity/type/count.

P4.03 remains internal, reversible and UI-technology neutral. It creates no IAM/policy engine, durable read model, graph database, generic business-approval state, public route/API/wire contract, Product Contract, new Platform Capability or lifecycle promotion.

Canonical evidence:

- [`P4.03 Canonical Record / Relationship inspection review`](../reviews/P4-03-canonical-record-relationship-inspection-experience.md) — `PASS`, four functional cross-review iterations;
- [`R9 Workspace Boundary Review`](../reviews/R9-workspace-boundary-review.md) — `PASS`;
- [`P4.02 Organization context / identity / scoped navigation shell review`](../reviews/P4-02-organization-context-identity-scoped-navigation-shell.md) — `PASS`;
- [`P4.01 operator journeys / workspace boundary / IA review`](../reviews/P4-01-operator-journeys-workspace-boundary-information-architecture.md) — `PASS`;
- [`PHASE-4-WORKSPACE-OPERATOR-EXPERIENCE.md`](PHASE-4-WORKSPACE-OPERATOR-EXPERIENCE.md) — Phase 4 remains `Active`;
- GitHub Actions `Reference Python CI #123` — `PASS`, Python `3.12.13`, `436` tests, `OK` on the P4.03 implementation branch before roadmap synchronization.

Phase 3 remains closed with `M3 — Validated shared capability baseline` achieved. CAP-001 through CAP-004 remain lifecycle `Incubating / Provisional`; P4.03 creates no new Platform Capability and promotes none to `Active`.

Phase 4 remains operator-experience first and UI-technology neutral. It proves coherent human interaction with governed organizational state and shared capability slices without turning presentation state into canonical authority or prematurely selecting a frontend/API/service topology.

## 3. Verified architecture baseline

- Constitution `1.2.0` — `Ratified`, frozen;
- RFC-0001 through RFC-0008 — `Accepted 1.0.0`;
- Phase 0 / `M0` — complete;
- Phase 1 / `M1` — complete;
- Phase 2 / `M2` — complete;
- Phase 3 / `M3` — complete / achieved for the bounded shared-capability reference scope;
- [`P3.12 closure review`](../reviews/P3-12-phase-3-m3-closure-review.md) — `PASS`;
- CAP-001 through CAP-004 remain `Incubating / Provisional`;
- no Platform Capability is `Active` merely because Phase 3 closed or Phase 4 is in progress;
- Phase 4 detailed roadmap remains `Active`;
- [`P4.01 review`](../reviews/P4-01-operator-journeys-workspace-boundary-information-architecture.md) — `PASS`;
- [`P4.02 review`](../reviews/P4-02-organization-context-identity-scoped-navigation-shell.md) — `PASS`;
- [`R9 review`](../reviews/R9-workspace-boundary-review.md) — `PASS`;
- [`P4.03 review`](../reviews/P4-03-canonical-record-relationship-inspection-experience.md) — `PASS`;
- no frontend framework, public route/API/BFF, IAM provider, durable workspace/read-model store, graph database or service topology is selected by P4.03;
- P4.03 introduces no new RFC, ADR, Product Contract or capability lifecycle change.

| `Phase 8` | Ecosystem and External Integration | Exploratory | ⬜ Draft | `M8` Governed external ecosystem baseline |

Phase status, capability lifecycle, operational environment and conformance maturity remain distinct.

## 5. Completed Phase 3 — Shared Platform Capabilities

Phase 3 closed at 100% with `P3.12 = PASS` and `M3 = Achieved` for the declared bounded reference scope.

Retained shared capabilities:

1. `CAP-001 — Document & Artifact Governance` — `Incubating`, Provisional;
2. `CAP-002 — Memory & Knowledge Governance` — `Incubating`, Provisional;
3. `CAP-003 — Search / Index Projection` — `Incubating`, Provisional, non-authoritative;
4. `CAP-004 — Audit / Reconstruction Support` — `Incubating`, Provisional, derived/read-oriented.

M3 does not imply lifecycle `Active`, operational readiness, Stable Product Contracts, public API compatibility, production deployment or customer-facing SLA/support commitments.

## 6. Active Phase 4 — Workspace / Operator Experience

Canonical detailed plan:

- [`PHASE-4-WORKSPACE-OPERATOR-EXPERIENCE.md`](PHASE-4-WORKSPACE-OPERATOR-EXPERIENCE.md) — `Active`.

| ID | Work item | Status | Progress |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `P4.01` | Operator journeys, workspace boundary and information architecture | 🟩 Complete | `██████████ 100%` |
| `P4.02` | Organization context, identity and scoped navigation shell | 🟩 Complete | `██████████ 100%` |
| `P4.03` | Canonical Record / Relationship inspection experience | 🟩 Complete | `██████████ 100%` |
| `P4.04` | Version, Event, provenance and reconstruction experience | ⬜ | `░░░░░░░░░░ 0%` |
| `P4.05` | Governed Execution, gate and approval/action experience | ⬜ | `░░░░░░░░░░ 0%` |
| `P4.06` | Document / Artifact workspace experience | ⬜ | `░░░░░░░░░░ 0%` |
| `P4.07` | Memory / Knowledge / Search discovery experience | ⬜ | `░░░░░░░░░░ 0%` |
| `P4.08` | Cross-capability task/context composition + bounded product entry point | ⬜ | `░░░░░░░░░░ 0%` |
| `P4.09` | Security, rights, minimization and authority-safe UX | ⬜ | `░░░░░░░░░░ 0%` |
| `P4.10` | Workspace architecture fitness + accessibility/usability baseline | ⬜ cross-cutting | `░░░░░░░░░░ 0%` |
| `P4.11` | Workspace hardening / ADR / refactoring review | ⬜ | `░░░░░░░░░░ 0%` |
| `P4.12` | Phase 4 / M4 closure review | ⬜ | `░░░░░░░░░░ 0%` |

Phase 4 roadmap work-item completion is `3 / 12 = 25.0%`. Engineering reviews such as R9 are gates and do not inflate this percentage as separate equal-weight work items.

Engineering gates:

- `R9 — Workspace Boundary Review` after P4.02 — **Complete / PASS**;
- `R10 — Operator Safety / Cross-Capability Health Review` after P4.07;
- `R11 — Composition / Usability Refactoring Review` after P4.08 / meaningful usability evidence;
- `R12 — M4 Workspace Hardening` after P4.10.

## 7. M4 target

`M4 — Coherent governed workspace baseline` requires evidence that, within the bounded reference scope:

1. an operator can navigate governed organizational state under explicit Organization/identity scope;
2. Canonical Records, immutable versions, relationships, Events and provenance remain semantically understandable;
3. consequential actions pass through Governed Execution with separate Authorization and Organizational Authority gates;
4. Document/Artifact and Memory/Knowledge/Search surfaces preserve their Accepted authority and lifecycle distinctions;
5. derived presentation/reconstruction/search state remains non-authoritative;
6. at least one Product Contract-backed bounded product entry point composes shared workspace surfaces without private platform coupling;
7. cross-capability rights, minimization and isolation pass fitness checks;
8. core operator journeys meet the declared accessibility/usability baseline;
9. any crossed ADR gates have canonical dispositions;
10. R9–R12 and P4.12 pass.

M4 is a bounded workspace milestone. It is not production readiness, full-platform conformance, Stable Product Contract/public API status, capability lifecycle `Active`, SLA/support or final commercial UX.

## 8. Current canonical action

> **`P4.04 — Version, Event, provenance and reconstruction experience`.**

Implement the smallest bounded internal history/provenance inspection surface over existing governed Event and reconstruction semantics. Event history must remain distinct from telemetry; causation/correlation and execution linkage must be shown only where governed evidence carries them; exact relied-upon versions must remain visible; reconstruction/replay must remain explicitly derived and non-authoritative; missing/redacted/unavailable/deleted evidence must be represented honestly.

P4.04 must carry forward P4.03's source-resolution rule: protected source/evidence dereference independently enforces current Organization/access constraints rather than trusting presentation state or identifiers. It must not pull Governed Execution action/approval semantics forward from P4.05 or stabilize a public route/API/wire/frontend/storage boundary.

## 9. ADR and Product Contract gate

Re-open the ADR gate before material reliance on concrete durable or externally constraining choices including frontend/runtime framework as a stable cross-product boundary, BFF/API topology, stable wire/serialization contracts, IAM/session enforcement, durable workspace/read-model/cache storage, search/index technology beyond replaceable projection semantics, document/object storage topology, stable design-system/package compatibility or separately deployable UI/API service topology.

A real Product relying on Incubating capabilities, canonical platform state or shared platform history must use the applicable RFC-0004 Product Contract before governed reliance.

## 10. Phase transition rule

Before Phase 5 becomes Active, revalidate its draft scope against M4 evidence and actual product/extension demand, then create a bounded `P5.xx` work breakdown and exit criteria.

A roadmap phase transition does not by itself change any Platform Capability lifecycle, operational environment, Product Contract stability or conformance state.

## 11. Roadmap maintenance rule

Every roadmap update begins with repository synchronization rather than chat-memory reconstruction. After every meaningful canonical milestone, synchronize the roadmap, record evidence, keep lifecycle/environment/conformance distinct, do not inflate Draft/Proposed/exploratory status, and preserve repository history rather than fabricating approvals.
